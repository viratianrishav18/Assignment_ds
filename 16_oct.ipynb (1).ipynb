        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: This is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have. It focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: This allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name. This can be achieved through method overriding (in subclasses) and method overloading (same method name with different parameters).\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition: This concept involves building complex types by combining objects (instances of classes) to form a more complex structure. It emphasizes a \"has-a\" relationship, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts work together to create a more organized, modular, and reusable codebase."
